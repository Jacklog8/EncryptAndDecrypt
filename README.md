# EncryptAndDecrypt
 Two console programs using AES to decrypt and encrypt a file. 

 encrypt/decrypt FilePath
 When decrypting you will need to enter a base64 encoded key which will be generated upon encryption.
 When encryting the key will be stored in the same directory as the file you are encrypting, the file will be called key.txt.
 
 Currently doesn't support whole directory encryption but that will be added in the future.
